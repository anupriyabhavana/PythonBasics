Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming with dynamic semantics

The developer of Python is Guido Van Rossum. It was developed in 1991. The inspiration for the name came from BBC’s TV Show – ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’

Interpreter and Compliers convert the source code (high level language) to machine code or assembly level ( 0 and 1)

Compiler:

    It converts high level language to intermediate assembly language by a complier and then assembled into machine code by an assembler

Interpreted:


Hybrid Approach
    Code privacy from compilation and portability from interpretation

Python is both complied and interpreted language

Python Virtual Machine (PVM) is a program which provides programming environment. The role of PVM is to convert the byte code instructions into machine code so the computer can execute those machine code instructions and display the output

The .py is the source code
    .pyc is the Complied Python File (bytecode)

if we provide .pyc file to PVM it converts the bytecode in the .pyc file to machine level language

To Get The Bytecode Of The .py file

    1. Open the interactive shell by typing python.exe in the command prompt
    2. import py_compile
    3. py_compile.compile('.py_filename_path') ex: py_compile.compile('C:\Users\abhin\OneDrive\Desktop\Python Programs\demo.py')
    4. >>>C:\\Users\\abhin\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Python Programs\\__pycache__\\demo.cpython-312.pyc
    5. The bytecode file is present in the above mentioned path ( usually in the pycache) folder


Advantages of Python
    1. Easy-to-learn & Easy-to-Use
        Python has very intuitive syntax. Reading python code is like reading English script with some punctuation which makes it so easy to learn, understand, read and code.
    
    2. Interpreted Language
        Python is designed as an interpreted language, which means the whole code would be executed line by line directly. If there is an error in between the block of code, that single error will get encountered right away causing the further program to stop, which assists in debugging the code fast. If that block contains multiple errors, only one error will be shown at a time, making it easier for the programmer to debug it

    3. Free & Open Source
        OSI(Open Source Initiative) has approved Python to be an open-source language that offers its users to use it for free and distribute. Programmers can download the source code from the internet, make some modifications, and can distribute their versions of python. This has leveraged many organizations by having their form of python and can use it for development accordingly.

    4. Easily Portable
        Portable is something that can be easily carried. Most programming languages like C and C++ need to be edited before running them on different platforms. This is one of the key advantages that python has over them. It is easily portable as once written, it can be run on any platform. This is referred to as Write Once Run Anywhere(WORA). However, the python program must not include any system-dependent features.

    5. Massive Libraries
        Python's usage has increased significantly due to its wide range of libraries. These enormous libraries include numerous functions already programmed that a user needs to use. Hence, the dependence on external libraries is very minimal.

    6. Cross Platform
        If we have made a python program on MAC then we can run the same code in the Linux, Windows or any other os without any changes

    7. GUI Programming support
        Python has many GUI libraries like Tkinter, PyQT5, Pside2

    8. Dynamically Typed Language
        There is no need to declare the datatype. Memory management is ensured internally by the use of a private heap in a python. Due to this feature there is not concept of pointers in the python
